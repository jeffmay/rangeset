You can run the unit tests by opening test/rangeset_test.html in your browser.

I recommend running any unit tests before making any changes, to verify that the
code works as intended.  Please right unit tests for any new changes to this code
in test/rangeset_test.js using the [QUnit](https://github.com/jquery/qunit)
javascript testing framework.
